| Model Name (API String) | Category | Why Use It? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`gemini-2.5-flash-lite`** | Text-out | **(Recommended)** Fastest and cheapest. Perfect for a high-volume scraping task. |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Text-out | Excellent balance of speed and power. A great default. |
| `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` | Text-out | The preview model you originally had. Also a great choice. |
